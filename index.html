            Our team has prepared a presentation called "The Hour of Code" to be given in No. 147 Technical and Humanitarian Lyceum on November 11 at 11:00. Through entertaining games and activities, we were able to create an amazing performance, engage kids, and inspire them to learn more about coding. Our crew has put in a tremendous amount of effort during the entire process and is always willing to pitch in when needed. We were able to prevent overworking and group conflicts by dividing the work equally among all of the group members. Throughout the course of the project, we aimed to inspire students to think about a career in coding and inform them of the plethora of opportunities available in the field. We feel that every single person in our group was able to contribute to our project and show companionship and cooperation throughout the whole process.
